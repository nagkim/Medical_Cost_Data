Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Project
About Project
The problem that is being tackled in this project is the estimation of health insurance costs using individuals personal and health-related information. It can be useful for insurance companies to estimate the cost of insuring a person.

Brief introduction
In this project, my main aim is to find the optimal regression model which would predict a fee that the insurance company will (presumably, annually) charge a new client for an insurance policy (I.P. for short). The possible sum is defined by following clientâ€™s personal features:

age
sex
body mass index (bmi)
number of children covered by health insurance (=number of children)
whether the client is smoker or not
region
The dataset I used in this project is the "Medical Cost Personal Datasets" available on Kaggle. The dataset contains information about 1338 individuals, including their age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, region, and medical expenses. I chose this data because it is real-world data, and the variables included can have a significant impact on medical insurance costs.
